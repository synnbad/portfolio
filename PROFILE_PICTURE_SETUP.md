# Profile Picture Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup

To add your profile picture to the portfolio:

1. **Rename your photo** to `profile-picture.jpg` (or `.png`)
2. **Copy it** to the `public/` folder in your project
3. The site will automatically use it!

## File Path
```
Portfolio-20Website/
└── public/
    └── profile-picture.jpg  ← Put your photo here
```

## Requirements
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Recommended 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
- **File name**: Must be exactly `profile-picture.jpg` or `profile-picture.png`

## What I Updated

✅ **Profile section**: Now looks for `/profile-picture.jpg` with automatic fallback  
✅ **Enhanced workspace visual**: Created a beautiful code editor mockup  
✅ **Project cards**: Added dynamic icons and visual elements for each project type  
✅ **Responsive design**: All images scale properly on mobile/desktop  

## Fallback Behavior

If no profile picture is found, the site shows a friendly "That's me! 👋" placeholder with your branding colors.
